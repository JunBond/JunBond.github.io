## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

My name is **Lingjun Sun**. I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in **Computer Science and Technology** at the [China University of Geosciences](https://www.cug.edu.cn/), where I will graduate in June 2026. Under the supervision of Prof. [Jining Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iYTHxQcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), my undergraduate research focuses on **multi-temporal hyperspectral remote sensing image sequence analysis**. Starting in the fall of 2026, I will begin my Ph.D. in **Information and Communication Engineering** at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Prof. [Liangqi Gui](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/guiliangqi/zh_CN/index/1527449/list/index.htm). My doctoral research will focus on **information and signal processing**.
